# Robot State Simulator

This project simulates the movement of a robot within a defined grid. The robot can rotate left (`L`), rotate right (`R`), or move forward (`M`) based on a given sequence of operations. The robot's position and direction are updated accordingly, and the final state is printed.

## Components

- `State`: Defines the current state of the robot including position and direction.
- `MaxHomeAssignment`: Main class to read input, process movements, and display output.

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac MaxHomeAssignment.java
java MaxHomeAssignment
